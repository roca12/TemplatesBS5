Building a project from scratch means that there is a lot of things to keep track of all at once: analytics, dynamic forms data, UI and UX elements, and much more. This simple admin template is well suited for web apps or any other website or project that requires admin dashboard. This template will serve as a solid foundation for your upcoming project and will save you a lot of time and, hence, money.

## Quick Start

#### 1. Get the latest version

You can start by cloning the latest version of Angular Material Admin on your local machine by running:

```shell
$ git clone -o angular-material-admin -b master --single-branch \
      https://github.com/flatlogic/angular-material-admin.git MyApp
$ cd MyApp
```

#### 2. Run `npm install`

This will install both run-time project dependencies and developer tools listed
in [package.json](../package.json) file.

#### 3. Run `npm start`

This command will build the app from the source files. Then open `localhost:4200` in your browser.

Now you can open your web app in a browser, on mobile devices and start
hacking. The page must be served from a web server, e.g. apache, nginx, WebStorm built-in web server, etc., otherwise some features may not work properly.
